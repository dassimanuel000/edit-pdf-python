*edit-pdf-python*

**Description**

This Python repository provides a script to merge multiple PDF files into a single document.

**Features**

- Merges multiple PDF files sequentially, preserving their order.

**Installation**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone @github.com/edit-pdf-python.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install PyPDF2  # May require additional dependencies based on your environment
   ```

**Usage**

1. Create a text file named `somefile.txt` in the same directory as this script. In each line, specify the full path to a PDF file you want to merge.
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python merge_pdfs.py  # Replace with the actual script name if different
   ```

**Example `somefile.txt` contents:**

```
/path/to/pdf1.pdf
/path/to/pdf2.pdf
/path/to/pdf3.pdf
# ... (list all PDF files you want to merge)
```

**Output**

A new merged PDF file will be created in the same directory, named `merged.pdf` by default. You can customize the output filename by modifying the script itself.

**Additional Notes**

- Ensure that the `somefile.txt` file exists and has the correct file paths.
- This script currently uses the `PyPDF2` library. Depending on your environment, you might need to install additional dependencies to handle specific PDF features.
- For more advanced PDF manipulation tasks, consider exploring other Python libraries like `PyMuPDF` or `ReportLab`.

**Additional Considerations**

- **Error Handling:** Consider incorporating error handling to gracefully handle potential issues like missing files, invalid file paths, or unsupported PDF features.
- **PDF Version Compatibility:** If necessary, explore approaches to address compatibility concerns across different PDF versions.
- **Performance Optimization:** For large PDF files, you might investigate ways to optimize the script for performance.
- **Testing:** To ensure code reliability, add unit tests to verify correct functionality.

By incorporating these suggestions and tailoring the README to your specific project details, you can create a comprehensive and informative guide for anyone using your repository.
